# PhotoSharingApp

This application, which is a social media application, allows us to register or log in to the system with an email and password and share the photos in our phone gallery with notes.
I provide my authentication and storage operations with FireBase.
The app also lists the uploaded photos on the timeline.
Even if we close the application, it does not ask for email and password unless logged out.
As long as the application is not logged out, every time we want to access the application, access is provided with the user who logged in last.
